      <description>1. Notes Real estate is all about wasting time. The more time you waste, the more money you can take. (p. 4)
Always develop on the area growth is comming. If you are a little early, the growth will bail you out. If you develop on an area that the growth is already done or it not continuing, if you are wrong, you are wrong forever. (p. 18)

      <description>1. Notes Mỗi khi nhân viên than thiếu người, Phan Văn Trường chọn cách cắt giảm nhân sự. Vì ông tin rằng, team đông người quá mức cần thiết cho nên dẫn tới việc thiếu đoàn kết, nên làm việc kém hiệu quả, công việc bị đình trệ. Khi nhân sự cắt giảm đi thì team gắn bó hơn, mọi người tranh nhau làm việc.
Người lớn với trẻ con cũng ko khác nhau là mấy, chỉ khác nhau ở việc dấu giếm, che đậy bản chất tính cách của mình.</description>

      <description>1. Notes Những thứ tác động nhanh ko nguy hiểm, tác động từ từ mới nguy hiểm. Câu chuyện chú ếch và hiệu ứng cá da trơn. (p. 139)
Không dành nhiều thời gian để dự đoán tương lai, vì như vậy dễ làm bỏ lỡ thời cơ đưa ra quyết sách. Chuyên gia kinh tế học cũng có những dự đoán sai lệch.
Phải giữ uy tín.
Phải biết nắm bắt cơ hội.</description>

      <guid>https://nhatduy129.github.io/post/ios/deep-understand-about-core-data/</guid>
      <description>1. Introduction Core Data provides on-disk persistence, which means your data will be accessible even after terminating your app or shutting down your device. This is different from in-memory persistence, which will only save your data as long as your app is in memory, either in the foreground or in the background. Xcode comes with a powerful Data Model editor, which you can use to create your managed object model.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction Push Notifications is a loud and powerful way for our apps to engage with our users. We engage with our users by letting them see values with their very owns eyes. Users see values. Users engage. We can engage our users by letting them know about something important. Perhaps their favorite sport team is about to compete. A flash sale on watermelons is on for 30 minutes. Or there is an important meet up in the desert later this weekend.</description>

In this article, I will show you 3 problems that you must pay attention when you use concurrency. Those are race conditions, deadlock and priority inversion.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go&amp;hellip;

      <description>This article is part 3 of serial concurrency tutorial, if you have not read part 1 and part 2, I recommend you read them first.
In this article, I will show you GCD and NSOperation. Advantages and disadvantages of them.
Common&amp;hellip;
1. Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) GCD is lowest level to support run the tasks concurrently. It is easy for impletation. Basically, we use GCD in most cases.
There are 3 kinds of queue in GCD.</description>

      <description>This article is part 2 of serial concurrency tutorial, if you have not read part 1, I recommend you read it first.
In this article, I will show you serial queue and concurrent queue. However, before we move on to them, we also need to know about synchronous and asynchronous.
1. Synchronous and asynchronous The tasks may either perform synchronous or asynchronous.
When the task is running as synchronous, your app will wait and lock current run loop until the task finishes.</description>

iPhone 7, 7S used 4-core
iphone 8, 8S used 6-core
iPhone XS, XS Max, XR used 8-core
2. What is process? To meet the demand running many applications at the same time.</description>
