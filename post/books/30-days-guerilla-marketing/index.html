<li>There are 2 types of research in marketing. How much our product? Why customer purchase? (p. 24)</li>

<p>Day 9: Identity and branding
Why does coca-cola spend milions of dollar on Super Bowl although people already know. The answer is they want to build their brand, brand create emotional to customers.
When people buy something, they consider by their emotional first, logic is the second.</p>
<p>Day 11: Advertising and media plan
Marketing and advertising are different, do not confuse it. Marketing is the process of identifying customer needs and determining how best to meet those needs. In contrast, advertising is the exercise of promoting a company and its products or services through paid channels. In other words, advertising is a component of marketing.
12 ads with the same message is better than 12 different ads with 12 different looks, 12 different messages. (p. 118)
Just like marketing, advertising works best through repetition. (p. 119)
&ldquo;Advertising components are Headline, body, offer, hook, call to action, ad graphics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Headline. On the average, people read the headline is 5 times more than the body copy.</li>
<li>All other components, open book and review them (p. 122)&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Day 16: Direct mail
Success is due 60% to the target list, 30% to the offer, 10% to the creativity of your mailing (p. 179)
Direct mail that looks like junk will not be opened to read. (p. 179)
Direct mail is junk when it is of no interest to the receiver. (p. 182)

The key of ads on radio, TV is repetition, repetition build awareness.</p>
<p>Bonus Day: Personalization
Part of marketing is getting prospect, customer&rsquo;s attention. One way, one big way to do that is using someone&rsquo;s name. Marketing cannot be successful until you get someone&rsquo;s attention (p. 200)</p>
<p>Day 24: Online marketing part 2
