      <description>This article is final part of serial concurrency tutorial, if you have not read part 1, part 2 and part 3, I recommend you read them first.
In this article, I will show you 3 problems that you must pay attention when you use concurrency. Those are race conditions, deadlock and priority inversion.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go&amp;hellip;
1. Race conditions Example you have two threads executing, they are both trying to modify an object&amp;rsquo;s count variable.</description>

      <description>This article is part 3 of serial concurrency tutorial, if you have not read part 1 and part 2, I recommend you read them first.
In this article, I will show you GCD and NSOperation. Advantages and disadvantages of them.
Common&amp;hellip;
1. Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) GCD is lowest level to support run the tasks concurrently. It is easy for impletation. Basically, we use GCD in most cases.
There are 3 kinds of queue in GCD.</description>

      <description>This article is part 2 of serial concurrency tutorial, if you have not read part 1, I recommend you read it first.
In this article, I will show you serial queue and concurrent queue. However, before we move on to them, we also need to know about synchronous and asynchronous.
1. Synchronous and asynchronous The tasks may either perform synchronous or asynchronous.
When the task is running as synchronous, your app will wait and lock current run loop until the task finishes.</description>

      <description>Before we learn deeply about concurrency in iOS, I will briefly show you the basic related knowledge. That are CPU, process and thread.
1. What is the CPU used in iPhone? Apple used many different CPU for their phone.
Example:
iPhone 6, 6S used dual core
iPhone 7, 7S used 4-core
iphone 8, 8S used 6-core
iPhone XS, XS Max, XR used 8-core
2. What is process? To meet the demand running many applications at the same time.</description>
